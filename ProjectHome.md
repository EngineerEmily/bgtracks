BGtracks was initially developed for the capstone project of the 2009 Bachelor's of Computer Science class at National University in conjunction with the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Sequoias.

It is an effort to meet the attendance tracking needs of the Boys & Girls Clubs while minimizing costs and encouraging a move toward the growing trend of open source software in the enterprise.
